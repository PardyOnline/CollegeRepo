# Interactive Visualizations of NFL Data

## Introduction
This project presents interactive visualizations of statistics for NFL quarterbacks and wide receivers from the 2007 season. It utilizes D3.js to create parallel coordinates plots that allow users to explore and interact with the data.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a modern web browser installed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
3. Open "index.html" in from your local web server to view the visualizations.

## File Descriptions
- "index.html": The main HTML file that hosts the visualizations.
- "script.js": The D3.js script for generating the quarterbacks visualization.
- "script1.js": The D3.js script for the wide receivers visualization.
- "style.css": The CSS file defining the styles for the web page and visualizations.
- "Tom Brady vs Average QB 2007.csv": Dataset containing quarterbacks statistics.
- "2007 WR.csv": Dataset containing wide receivers statistics.

## Data Sources
The datasets used in this project are:
- "Tom Brady vs Average QB 2007.csv": A comparison of Tom Brady's 2007 season statistics against the average quarterback's statistics.
- "2007 WR.csv": Season statistics for various wide receivers in 2007.

## Usage
Upon loading the visualizations in a web browser, users can:

- Hover over the parallel coordinates to see detailed statistics for each player.
- Use the tabs to switch between different data visualizations.

For the best experience, use a modern web browser that supports SVG rendering.

## Dependencies
- D3.js (v6): A JavaScript library for visualizing data using web standards.

## Data Sources
- Data was sourced from 2 places: - https://www.statmuse.com/
                                  - https://www.pro-football-reference.com/
- Please note, some stats taken from these sites were divided by 16 to create the per game stats used.
